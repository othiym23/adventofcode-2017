## Advent of Code 2017

Wanna play? Please do! Go to [http://adventofcode.com/2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017).

For now, I have yavascript solutions, kept separate from their inputs. If I have time, I
may write additional solutions in Rust, Idris, Befunge, or Tcl, as the mood takes me,
hence the separate inputs.

As code written for a friendly leaderboard challenge, this code is all
available under the principle of fair use. If you decide to copy any of it for
some weird private leaderboard chasing, that's all on you. If you decide to run
your nuclear reactor with any code contained herein, that is also on you. The
code was written as fast as I could and is indubitably filled with all kinds of
bugs.

Inasmuch as I can claim any rights to this code, I relinquish them into the
public domain.
